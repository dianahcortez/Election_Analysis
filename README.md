## Challenge Overview
After submitting my initial analysis, additional data has been requested from the client, the election commission.  The client would like the below data:
1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
3. The county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary
In performing this additional analysis we can see that Denver County had the greatest voter turnout at 82.8% of the total votes.  This allows the client to see what counties they might want to focus on in statewide voting initiatives down the road.
